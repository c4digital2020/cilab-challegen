# The Cilab e-commerce concept

Greetings! As a potential new-hire we want to put you in charge of your own ecommerce

## The Challenge

Your challenge is to build a Full Stack Web app that lets the user buy some products from the catalogue (of your choice), and check the cart with all products selected

### How it behaves:

- When browser load, show a product
- Click to product to show details of products
- When browser's refreshed, the session must remain intact - the user and order details persist.
- The app must use styling (even if it's not pretty). Extra points for [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) or [Styled Component](https://styled-components.com/).

### The technology

- Wordpress + Woocommerce
- React (usingÂ [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/), you may switch it out if you wish)
- MySQL

### Questions

When you give us your task back, we expect you to answer these questions:

- What would you improve with your code?
- How would you scale your code for more users?
- Is there anything you think we should change about this test?

We will use them when we read your code, to try and understand your thought process, so that even if it's not perfect (or even done), we are able to give you a fair chance! :)

## How to get started

1. Clone this repository
2. Checkout a new branch to work on
3. Import the database in the Wordpress (sql folder)
4. Run npm start in frontend folder
5. Start writing! Good luck

## How to send things back

Create a new repo in your github, and send us the repo with all files to check all task
